# Guess The Language

## I used this app to get familiarized with node and npm. It takes a string of words (must be more than 10 letters at least) and it tries to guess what language is it written in.

## How to use this app:

-   First you have to clone this repo, run: git clone `SSH` or `The Url of this repo`
-   Run `npm install` without arguments to install all necessary packages.
-   Start node by inputting in your terminal `node`, then do `node index.js "your string of words to be guessed here"`
