# Guess The Language

## I used this app to get familiarized with node and npm. It takes a string of words (must be more than 10 letters at least) and it tries to guess what language is it written in.

## How to use this app:

-   First you have to clone this repo, run: git clone `SSH of this repo` or `The Url of this repo`
-   Run `npm install` without arguments to install all necessary packages.
-   Start node by inputting in your terminal `node`, then do: `node index.js "your string of words to be guessed here"`

## What packages do I have to install?

This project uses 3 packages:
[franc package](https://github.com/wooorm/franc).
[Nodes Langs](https://github.com/adlawson/nodejs-langs).
[Colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors)
